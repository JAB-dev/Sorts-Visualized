# Is this updated?
meh, I do plan on adding more sorts and more controls, such as array length(not super hard to add). As well as sorting sounds which are semi do-able at the moment (Sounds bad)

# Why are there so many download buttons?
githubs defaults be like that. I don't, at the moment, want to do the css and html myself
